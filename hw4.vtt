00:00:04:21 --> 00:00:22:18
Something I experienced growing up, as I always felt very disconnected from my mom's side of the family. Even when we would have get-->togethers, I felt like everybody else belonged in the same group. Like they looked like they came from the same clan, so to speak. And I just stuck out like a sore thumb. And I didn't know why.

2
00:00:23:00 --> 00:00:45:14
I didn't know why I felt so different. It wasn't just appearance. I have a bit of a darker complexion. I have darker hair, thick eyebrows, a darker skin tone, but it's also just personality. I don't get their sense of humor. I - they just - I don't get their banter. It just - they don't make sense to me. And I always just was so acutely aware of these differences.

3
00:00:46:03 --> 00:01:04:05
And I always felt guilty for thinking this way. I thought I was creating the problem that was due to my own mindset. But knowing that there was a reason why I would feel like I don't fit in as well as a bunch of people who are closely related, you know, makes a lot of sense. And I feel like I don't feel bad about that anymore.

4
00:01:04:14 --> 00:01:31:01
I feel justified in my thinking, but what people don't talk about is the children that come from egg donation. My name is Emma and my parents use an egg donor to conceive me. I grew up never knowing this. Nobody ever told me. To me, egg donation is simply one person giving their eggs to another so that they can conceive a child but what I think about the term is egg donation.

5
00:01:31:01 --> 00:01:56:01
Other things come to mind as well. I think about financial transactions because egg donors are paid a lot of money for giving their eggs, and I believe rightfully so. After all, they're giving a lot of their time and they're giving something very personal. They're going through a lot of unpleasant medical procedures, but it's still a financial transaction.

6
00:01:56:01 --> 00:02:15:08
And I believe that it's often done out of financial needs from the donor. Sometimes close friends or family members will donate their eggs. A lot of times you have no idea where that egg is coming from and the donor will never meet the recipient or the children produced from the donation to that recipient.

7
00:02:31:22 --> 00:03:00:05
I managed to get in contact with my biological half-sister, who is also a product of the same cycle of egg donation from that donor. The timing was actually really, really interesting and fortuitous. One day, I had matched with her on Ancestry.com. When I finally got my DNA results, they actually placed us as first cousins. That's what they said the relationship was.

8
00:03:01:06 --> 00:03:27:02
So I just sent a message. I said, “Hey, you know, I was part of an egg donor. I'm really interested in getting in touch with that side of my family. Please contact me if you're willing to speak.” And I get a call from her and she says that “Hey, I'm a product of an egg donor, too. And I actually think that we're siblings because we share 25% of our DNA.

9
00:03:27:12 --> 00:03:52:23
That's not a cousin relationship. That's much closer than that.” We're the same age. We met for the very first time and we told my dad together. It's funny, he was gobsmacked. You should have seen his jaw just drop. I've never seen him react like that. And his first reaction was to like, basically take mug shots of is like what you do in a prison line up or something.

10
00:03:52:23 --> 00:04:17:19
He took pictures of us from the front and then each of our sides was to see how similar we looked. And he shared any physical features and you know, since that time, I've gotten to know her family. Her parents are lovely, and we've just grown a lot closer over the years. I'm really lucky and grateful to have her as a friend.

11
00:04:36:21 --> 00:05:01:22
I am looking for the egg donor. I would just really like to meet her and see what she's like and hear about her life. And it would be really cool to see what we have in common. If anything, really, you know, provide an interesting answer to the nature versus nurture debate. My half sister feels similarly about that, you know, I envisioned her being a certain way.

12
00:05:01:22 --> 00:05:25:00
My dad made the offhand comment that he thought that she was an artist or a dancer or something. So I thought, Oh man, she's a struggling artist in New York and I really enjoy art dance, so she's probably a lot like me and I feel really bad. Then when I met there. So the interesting thing is her family had a different experience with the donation process than mine.

13
00:05:25:08 --> 00:05:52:12
Her father is a doctor, and we suspect that that's why they were given, I guess I would say, more preferential treatment. They weren't subjected to the same kinds of psych evaluations that my parents were, and they were also given more information about the donor. Supposedly, my parents didn't really get a bio or description. They were just able to ask like yes or no questions and make certain requests and be matched accordingly.

14
00:05:53:03 --> 00:06:25:05
But Daryn's family actually received a short bio about the donor, which they haven't found yet, and I would really like to see. But they told me that the donor has organ hair and green eyes, and she's five, six, and she was studying linguistics and she's half German, half Irish. And it just kind of ended my mental image of this person and it's just been harder to think about her because I have these conflicting stories in my head.

00:06:25:05 --> 00:06:40:13
I guess, you know, first impressions are really strong and I had such a strong reaction when I first conjured up that image of her. And now it-it's just-it's hard. It's hard because these things are kind of at war with each other.

00:06:59:18 --> 00:07:25:15
I've been looking for her. There's more I could do to look for her, but I really don't want to violate her privacy. I do want to get in contact with her, but not at the expense of her well being at the time when she did that, she promised to remain totally anonymous. And they could have never predicted that these sites would become available and they would be able to do this kind of genetic testing within her lifetime.

15
00:07:26:02 --> 00:07:59:00
So I want to be respectful of that. When I first made the realization that I'm the product of egg donation, I was thinking about my biological mom all the time. I was really worried about her. I figured since the donation took place almost 25 years ago, the technology was new and experimental. It was a lot more dangerous that we're using much higher doses of hormones; they didn't have the same safety measures.

16
00:07:59:23 --> 00:08:27:23
I just figured she must have been in a very desperate place to do this. Because who would want to subject their body to this kind of torment for any other reason? I'm pretty sure she was a student when that happened, or so I thought. She must have really been struggling and I was worried. I just constantly thought about her and hope that she was okay and I was worried that she might have been exploited and that would have been terrible.

17
00:08:28:01 --> 00:08:50:23
My heart just really went out to her and I felt bad. I think people should consider adoption and fostering more. I understand that it's not fair to expect more from people who have fertility issues and the world from any other random person. But I am very much in favor of those two options because there are lots of kids who need homes.

18
00:08:51:08 --> 00:09:05:18
So I don't know why we have to put so much time and so many resources into doing these expensive, dangerous, risky medical procedures. When there are plenty of other ways to have children.
