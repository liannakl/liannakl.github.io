    <h3>Static Website</h3>
    <p>A static website I found and liked is called <a href="https://pointerpointer.com/">Pointer Pointer</a>. I like this website because it's entertaining, and your cursor will always be found, but the site dispays a different image every time the cursor is moved. This is a static website because no data is collected.</p>

    <h3>Dynamic Website</h3>
    <p>A dynamic website I found and liked is <a href="https://earcouture.jp/">earCOUTURE</a>. I loved how smooth the transitions on the site are, even when moving from page to page. This website is dynamic because when visitors are on the site, they are not shown the same image on the homepage.</p>
