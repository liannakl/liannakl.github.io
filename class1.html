    <h3>Static Website</h3>
    <p>A static website I found and liked is called <a href="https://www.staggeringbeauty.com/">Staggering Beauty</a>. I like that the site is visually simple, yet when you move the mouse, the black blob follows the cursor. Although, when you move the mouse too quick, there are flashing images and there is a warning about that for people with epilepsy at the bottom of the page. This page is static because it doesn't collect any sort of data and is displayed the same for each visitor.</p>

    <h3>Dynamic Website</h3>
    <p>A dynamic website I found and liked is <a href="https://earcouture.jp/">earCOUTURE</a>. I loved how smooth the transitions on the site are, even when moving from page to page. This website is dynamic because when visitors are on the site, they are not shown the same image on the homepage.</p>
